This project is part of the foundations course for The Odin Project, which is designed to teach full stack web development from scratch. Although I have my degree in computer science, I am going through the Odin Project for practice and to fill any gaps in my knowledge. The project assigned is a simple recepie website based off the skills taught so far.
